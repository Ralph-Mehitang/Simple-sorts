#simple-sorts
(a) the timing increases the larget the size of the array you are passing to it. the type of algorithm doesn't matter. going from seconds for array sizes under 50 to minutes for larger arrays.
(b)The best time complexity for bubble is omega(n) with the worst being O(n^2)
the best for insertion sort is omega(n) and the worst being (On^2)
the best for selection is omega(n^2) and the worst being O(n^2)
(c)for random order numbers of array size 25 it takes .0107751s seconds using bubble sort. for 50 nums using insertion sort it takes 0.0010246 seconds.
for 100 using numbers using selection sort it takes 0.0071659 seconds.
for 50 numbers that have already been sorted using selection sort it takes 0.0009865 seconds
50 duplicate elements using bubble sort takes 0.00153 seconds.
50 arrays that are sorted backwards using bubble sort takes 0.000804 seconds.
(d) From looking at my code, I can't see anywhere I would need to improve my code. I htink everything is properly commented. i make the menu rather straightforward and I have no memory leaks
